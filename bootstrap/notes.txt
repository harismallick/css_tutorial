Notes from the bootstrap tutorial

Bootstrap styling is based on a grid, of column and rows.
There's 3 levels to the grid system:
- Container
    - Rows
    - Columns

Each container has a grid of rows and columns.

Depending on the size of the pixels and the size of the screen, the bootstrap default properties 
for the container change.

Need to nest a div of class 'col' inside a div of class 'row' inside a div of class 'container' for bootstrap to function.
Each row has 12 resizable columns in its grid.
If just 'col' class used, then all declared columns will be resized to equal lengths.
If certain columns need to be of a particular size, this can be declared in the class name, like: col-6
This will ensure that the declared column is 50% of the size of the row.
The other 11 possible rows will be of equal size in the remaining row width.

You can assign an array of class names to each row and column div to behave differently for different screen sizes.
You can also nest another row class inside a column class, to split that column into more rows.
